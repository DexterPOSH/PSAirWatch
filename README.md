PowerShell Module for AirWatch.
This is a minimalitic PowerShell AW module , I wrote at one of the Hackathons.
Wrapper around the REST API's exposed by the Vendor.

Haven't worked with AW REST API's in a while so this might be outdated, but can surely help anyone who is looking to go down the path.
You can fork the project and get going. I don't have an AW setup to continue the development at the moment.

Targeted - AW v8.0 (only managing Users (basic & directory).
